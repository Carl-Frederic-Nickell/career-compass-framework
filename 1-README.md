# Career Compass Framework

A structured, AI-assisted career strategy framework for career transitions and professional development.

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach to career planning, combining deep self-assessment with AI-powered market research to create actionable career strategies. Originally developed for tech career transitions (Marketing → DevOps/Security), but adaptable to any field.

## How It Works

```
Step 1: Answer 85 Questions → Deep self-assessment
Step 2: Discovery Prompt    → AI recommends 3-5 career paths
Step 3: Final Strategy      → Market-validated action plan with 90-day roadmap
```

## Supporting Documents (Optional)

## Tips for Best Results

### During Self-Assessment
- Be brutally honest - the AI can only work with what you provide
- Use specific numbers and metrics where possible
- Include context and examples, not just short answers
- Don't skip questions - write "N/A" with explanation if not applicable

### During AI Sessions
- Use an AI with web search for market research (Step 3)
- Provide your complete Q1-Q85 answers
- Review outputs critically - AI recommendations are starting points
- Iterate if initial recommendations don't feel right

### After Receiving Strategy
- Take 24-48 hours to reflect before acting
- Share plan with accountability partner
- Start executing Week 1 actions immediately
- Review progress monthly using the checkpoint questions

## Customization

This framework is designed for career transitions but can be adapted:

- **Industry-specific**: Modify questions for your field
- **Experience level**: Adjust for entry-level vs. executive transitions

## Output Examples

1. **Discovery Output**: 3-5 recommended career paths with detailed analysis

   - Market-validated path assessment
